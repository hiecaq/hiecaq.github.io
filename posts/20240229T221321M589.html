<li>There is an energy (stomach) system. Basically, move spends 1
energy, attack spend 1 or more energy depending on the weapon, shooting
spend 2 energy, blocking spend 1 energy. When you wait, energy regain in
the number of your consecutive waiting turns.</li>
<li>Instead of a hungry clock, the game progress is pushed by things
having durability.</li>
<li>you can combine things onto things, like a cons list. Longer list is
heavier, spending more energy per wave. Combined things durability is
decreased altogether. That is, if you combine a sword 3/3 with a dagger
2/2, after an attack the durability becomes 2/3 and 1/2. Whenever
something broken, the rest things stay combined for simplicity. Imagine
that your combine has superpower.</li>
<li>There is a "balance" bar for each creature. When balance reach 5
(just an arbitrary number right now), the creature will be knocked back
by 1 tile from the attack direction.</li>
<li>If you block, the very next single attack next turn will not do any
damage to you totally. Also if it is a melee attack, the blocked
creature's balance becomes 5.</li>
<li>There are fruits that can be combined, or throw directly.</li>
</ul>

<li>Instead of level-based map generation, put all floors into a single
open world.</li>
<li>prefabs like treasure room in the temple.</li>
<li>cooking for buffs</li>
