<p>
In the game I'm prototyping, which is a 3D Roguelike, multi-tile creatures and multi-tile vehicles are essentially the same thing.
</p>

<p>
This post surveys how they should be implemented, particularly, how their movement should be implemented.
</p>
<div class="outline-2">
<h2>Goals</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2">
</div>
<div class="outline-3">
<h3>Move all parts together</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3">
<p>
This also means, whenever a single part cannot be moved, all parts should be prevented from moving.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="outline-3">
<h3>Have Faced Direction</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3">
<p>
Multi-tile things are big, so their faced directions matters.
</p>

<p>
Moreover, their XY plane is not limited to just squares.  So we can have 3x2 too.  In this case, faced direction matters a lot.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="outline-3">
<h3>Moves on uneven ground</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3">
<p>
So if the ground is varying on the height grid by grid, the multi-tile thing can moves on top of it.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="outline-3">
<h3>Things on it should move together</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3">
<p>
This is more relevant for vehicles; maybe monsters too!
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="outline-3">
<h3>Optional: Different parts have different defense</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3">
<p>
Inspired by monster hunter!
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="outline-3">
<h3>Optional: Some actions are produced from some specific parts</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3">
<p>
Fire Beams, etc
</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="outline-2">
<h2>Case Study</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2">
<p>
Let's consider some edge cases:
</p>
</div>
<div class="outline-3">
<h3>Moving on a flat plane towards a single block obstacle</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3">
<p>
The object should be blocked by the obstacle, or destroy it!
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="outline-3">
<h3>Moving on a flat plane with some small holes</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3">
<p>
The object should be able to do that, as long as the holes are not significant enough
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="outline-3">
<h3>Moving on an uphill</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3">
<p>
This basically means: compared to the first case, in which cases should the altitude of the object be increased?
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="outline-3">
<h3>Moving on an downhill</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3">
<p>
This is the reverse of the previous case
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="outline-3">
<h3>Failing onto an uneven plane</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3">
<p>
For example, 3x3 creatures fall onto a plane with an obstacle in the very center
</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="outline-2">
<h2>Implementation thoughts</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2">
<p>
Let's call the tiles of these entity parts from now on.
</p>

<p>
To move, a valid candidate position requires at least one of the bottom parts stand on blocks.
For 4-leg monsters, this means their 2 front legs stands on the upward hill, or 2 back legs stands on the downward hill.
</p>

<p>
Otherwise, the position is not valid, and trying moving into this position fail, i.e blocked.
</p>

<p>
Also, if the blocking obstacle is not fixed, for example creatures, based on some stats they are kicked away.
</p>

<p>
Turning around is basically the same.
</p>

<p>
For simplicity, there should is no automatic climbing.
