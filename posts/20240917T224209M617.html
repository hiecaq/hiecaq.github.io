<p>In the game I'm prototyping, which is a 3D Roguelike, multi-tile
creatures and multi-tile vehicles are essentially the same thing.</p>
<p>This post surveys how they should be implemented, particularly, how
their movement should be implemented.</p>
<h1 id="goals">Goals</h1>
<h2 id="move-all-parts-together">Move all parts together</h2>
<p>This also means, whenever a single part cannot be moved, all parts
should be prevented from moving.</p>
<h2 id="have-faced-direction">Have Faced Direction</h2>
<p>Multi-tile things are big, so their faced directions matters.</p>
<p>Moreover, their XY plane is not limited to just squares. So we can
have 3x2 too. In this case, faced direction matters a lot.</p>
<h2 id="moves-on-uneven-ground">Moves on uneven ground</h2>
<p>So if the ground is varying on the height grid by grid, the
multi-tile thing can moves on top of it.</p>
<h2 id="things-on-it-should-move-together">Things on it should move
together</h2>
<p>This is more relevant for vehicles; maybe monsters too!</p>
<h2 id="optional-different-parts-have-different-defense">Optional:
Different parts have different defense</h2>
<p>Inspired by monster hunter!</p>
<h2
id="optional-some-actions-are-produced-from-some-specific-parts">Optional:
Some actions are produced from some specific parts</h2>
<p>Fire Beams, etc</p>
<h1 id="case-study">Case Study</h1>
<p>Let's consider some edge cases:</p>
<h2 id="moving-on-a-flat-plane-towards-a-single-block-obstacle">Moving
on a flat plane towards a single block obstacle</h2>
<p>The object should be blocked by the obstacle, or destroy it!</p>
<h2 id="moving-on-a-flat-plane-with-some-small-holes">Moving on a flat
plane with some small holes</h2>
<p>The object should be able to do that, as long as the holes are not
significant enough</p>
<h2 id="moving-on-an-uphill">Moving on an uphill</h2>
<p>This basically means: compared to the first case, in which cases
should the altitude of the object be increased?</p>
<h2 id="moving-on-an-downhill">Moving on an downhill</h2>
<p>This is the reverse of the previous case</p>
<h2 id="failing-onto-an-uneven-plane">Failing onto an uneven plane</h2>
<p>For example, 3x3 creatures fall onto a plane with an obstacle in the
very center</p>
<h1 id="implementation-thoughts">Implementation thoughts</h1>
<p>Let's call the tiles of these entity parts from now on.</p>
<p>To move, a valid candidate position requires at least one of the
bottom parts stand on blocks. For 4-leg monsters, this means their 2
front legs stands on the upward hill, or 2 back legs stands on the
downward hill.</p>
<p>Otherwise, the position is not valid, and trying moving into this
position fail, i.e blocked.</p>
<p>Also, if the blocking obstacle is not fixed, for example creatures,
based on some stats they are kicked away.</p>
<p>Turning around is basically the same.</p>
<p>For simplicity, there should is no automatic climbing.</p>
