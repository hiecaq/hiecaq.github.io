<p>Whenever I copied a remote file/directory over SSH with rsync, for
example</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1" data-org-language="sh"><pre
class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb1-1"><a href="#cb1-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="fu">rsync</span> <span class="at">-Ptr</span> <span class="st">&#39;remote:downloads/文件夹/&#39;</span> .</span></code></pre></div>
<p>It always failed with</p>
<pre class="example"><code>rsync: [sender] change_dir &quot;/home/[me]/downloads/[random encoding here]&quot; failed: No such file or directory (2)
rsync error: some files/attrs were not transferred (see previous errors) (code 23) at main.c(1861) [Receiver=3.2.7]
rsync: [Receiver] write error: Broken pipe (32)
</code></pre>
<p>This has troubled me for such a long time but I used to just ignore
it: I moved the file or directory into a directory that has no non-ASCII
character in its name and just copied that directory instead. This works
well until I decided to move more and more of my command line daily
activities into Emacs. Dired itself allows you to copy remote files over
tramp, but it is extremely slow on files larger than a few KBs, and even
worse it is blocking, so you cannot do anything when it is copying.</p>
<p>So I found a package called <a
href="https://github.com/stsquad/dired-rsync">dired-rsync</a>, which use
the beloved rsync and is asynchronous when copying. However, it simply
fails to copy anything contains non-ASCII character in its path. Now I
seriously began to figure out what's going on and more importantly how
should I fix it.</p>
<h1 id="wrong-guess">Wrong guess?</h1>
<p>So the first thing I think of is locale. Why do I think that? For
example:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb3" data-org-language="sh"><pre
class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb3-1"><a href="#cb3-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="fu">ssh</span> remote echo <span class="st">&#39;$LANG&#39;</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>This will print quite differently from you might expect. The reason
is that, when run a command over SSH in this way, the command is
executed in a non-login shell. A non-login shell means that <code
class="verbatim">/etc/profile</code> is not loaded, which means <code
class="verbatim">/etc/profile.d/locale.sh</code> is not loaded, which
means <code class="verbatim">LANG</code> is very likely to be left
unset, if your environment is set-up the same way as I do.</p>
<p>To test this, compare the following 2 line's result:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb4" data-org-language="sh"><pre
class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb4-1"><a href="#cb4-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="fu">ssh</span> ezpro <span class="st">&#39;bash -c &quot;echo \&quot;\$LANG\&quot;&quot;&#39;</span></span></code></pre></div>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb5" data-org-language="sh"><pre
class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb5-1"><a href="#cb5-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="fu">ssh</span> ezpro <span class="st">&#39;bash -c -l &quot;echo \&quot;\$LANG\&quot;&quot;&#39;</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>That means locale is very likely to be not set correctly in the
environment rsync's part over SSH is running, which might lead to its
broken handling of non-ASCII path. Makes sense? Well, maybe. It turns
out that the solution does not need to handle locale in some way, so
forget about this part.</p>
<h1 id="simple-fix">Simple Fix</h1>
<p>The solution is ironically simple: just use <code
class="verbatim">-s</code> flag. From its man page:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>–secluded-args, -s This option sends all filenames and most options
to the remote rsync via the protocol (not the remote shell command line)
which avoids letting the remote shell modify them. Wildcards are
expanded on the remote host by rsync instead of a shell. […]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Adding this flag simply JUST WORKS. No other changes to the
invocation is needed. I found this solution <a
href="https://askubuntu.com/questions/99898/how-to-rsync-a-folder-when-the-folder-path-contains-special-chars/994488#994488">from
an AskUbuntu answer</a>.</p>
