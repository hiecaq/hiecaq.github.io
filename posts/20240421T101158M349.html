<p>The overall state machine is as follows:</p>
<pre class="plantuml" data-file="images/20240421T101158M349.png"><code>[*] --&gt; Initialize
Initialize --&gt; ViewMapGen

Initialize --&gt; Publish_PickActor : Play

Publish_PickActor --&gt; PickActor

PickActor --&gt; PlayerInput : Need \n player \n input
PickActor --&gt; MobAct

PlayerInput --&gt; PlayerInput
PlayerInput --&gt; PerformAction : Action
PlayerInput --&gt; Publish_PlayerInput
Publish_PlayerInput --&gt; PlayerInput

MobAct --&gt; PerformAction : Action

PerformAction --&gt; EffectOutcome : Effects

EffectOutcome --&gt; Publish_PickActor
</code></pre>
<p><img src="../images/20240421T101158M349.png" /></p>
<p>More specifically:</p>
<h1 id="action">Action</h1>
<p>Actions are fixed number inputs from mobs or the player. Depending on
their current status, for example equipment, different kinds of effects
will be produced.</p>
<h1 id="effect">Effect</h1>
<p>Effects are the "events happened in the world", for example:</p>
<dl>
<dt>Spatial changes</dt>
<dd>
something is moved to somewhere
</dd>
<dt>Chrono changes</dt>
<dd>
the clock is updated to a newer value
</dd>
</dl>
<p>They are not the direct outcomes though: They can be modified or
canceled. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>spatial changes can be canceled if the position the target is moved
into is somewhere cannot be entered</li>
<li>attack damage will be reduced based on the target's armor and
resistance.</li>
</ul>
<p>So actions are active things to do, effects are the passive effects
to the target affected by the actions.</p>
<h1 id="turns">Turns</h1>
<p>The game loop is more or less ATB-based and energy-based. Each mob
(including the player) unit has a timestamp, and at <code
class="verbatim">PickActor</code> state the one with the lowest
timestamp in the priority queue is picked. If it is controlled by the
player, the game switches to <code class="verbatim">PlayerInput</code>
state where the UI inputs are listened; otherwise, it goes to the <code
class="verbatim">MobAct</code> state, where the AI (in the good old
sense) decides the action to perform.</p>
<p>In either case, once the chosen mob has decided what to do, the game
switches to <code class="verbatim">PerformAction</code> state. Based on
the given action, effects are produced. It is very likely that an <code
class="verbatim">ChornoChange</code> effect is produced, which updates
the actor's timestamp and thus puts it into a later position in the
priority queue.</p>
<h1 id="how-inspection-fits-into-this-architecture">How Inspection Fits
into This Architecture?</h1>
<p>Inspection is an action that produces journals that displayed to the
UI. It does not produces any real effects.</p>
<p>This might subject to change.</p>
<h1 id="how-debuff-like-poison-fits-into-this-architecture">How Debuff
(like Poison) Fits into This Architecture?</h1>
<p>I have a quick and dirty imagined solution that basically have some
invisible "gods" that performs actions in a fixed interval, to all mobs
that carry the corresponding debuff.</p>
<p>For example, if a mob is poisoned, the God of Poison performs direct
damage to it every 100 time unit.</p>
<h1 id="how-attack-fits-into-this-architecture">How Attack Fits into
This Architecture?</h1>
<p>Consider that the player has decided to attack a slime. So the
transition is from <code class="verbatim">PlayerInput</code> to <code
class="verbatim">PerformAction</code>. Nothing fancy goes on in this
transition, and the <code class="verbatim">PerformAction</code> state
gets the actor (the player), the target (the slime) and the action
(Attack).</p>
<h2 id="perform-the-action">Perform the Action</h2>
<p>Say the player has a "sword of flame, the Slime Slayer" as its
weapon.</p>
<p>The following effects are produced, based on the player's stats:</p>
<ul>
<li>A "Raw Damage" effect on the slime, which is mixture of physics and
fire elements, amplified by the "Slime Slayer" bless, targeting the
slime</li>
<li>A "Time Update" effect on the player, say 100 unit of time.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now the state is transitioned into <code
class="verbatim">EffectOutcome</code>.</p>
<h2 id="apply-the-effects">Apply the Effects</h2>
<dl>
<dt>Raw Damage</dt>
<dd>
The physical parts of the damage is reduced by the slime's armor. The
flame parts of the damage is reduced by the slime's fire resistance. The
values after that is subtracted from the slime's health.
</dd>
<dt>Time Update</dt>
<dd>
The timestamp of player is increased by 100
</dd>
